# Personal Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! I'm a student from Bergamo, Italy, with a background in Electronics and Robotics.  
This repository serves as my personal engineering diary â€” a place where I document various projects related to electronics, robotics, automation, and embedded systems.
The content in this repository includes:
- Electronics circuits and PCB designs
- Robotics and automation experiments
- Embedded systems with microcontrollers
- Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and sensor-based projects
- Source code, schematics, and documentation

This portfolio is meant to track my technical growth and showcase my work throughout my academic and personal learning journey.
